# Program-for-Data-Analysis-Project

This Project was to create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon, the phenomenon selected was weather data specifically the relation of
weather variables and percipitation i.e. the effect different variables on the quantity of rainfall.

The main requirementd of this project was to:

• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four di?erent variables.
• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other. 
• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible. 
• Detail the research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook. 

Note that this project was about simulation and the requirement was to synthesise the data set.
